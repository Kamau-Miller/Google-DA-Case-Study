## Introduction

Welcome to the Cyclistic Bike-Share Case Study repository! This project is part of the Google Data Analyst Certificate program and aims to analyze data from Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago, to provide insights and recommendations for marketing strategies.

## Business Task

The primary business task of this case study is to understand how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently. We aim to answer questions like why casual riders would buy annual memberships and how digital media can influence casual riders to become members.

## Data Sources

- The data for this analysis was provided by Cyclistic and includes historical trip data.
- Data privacy considerations prevent us from using personally identifiable information.

## Data Preparation

- Data was cleaned and transformed for analysis.
- New columns like `ride_length` and `day_of_week` were created.
- Data integrity was ensured, and any errors or missing values were addressed.

## Data Analysis

- We performed data analysis using SQL and spreadsheet tools.
- Calculated metrics like average ride length for annual members and casual riders.
- Analyzed ride patterns by day of the week.
- Explored trends in ride data.

## Visualizations

- Visualized our findings using Tableau.
- Created  a bar chart to present insights.
- Used visualizations to compare user behavior and trends.

## Recommendations

- Based on our analysis, we propose marketing strategies to convert casual riders into annual members.
- Recommendations are backed by data-driven insights.
